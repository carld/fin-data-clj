# fin-data

This application will parse the Official Cash Rate from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand web site.
It saves the rate, announcement date, and link to the announcement in a PostgresQL database.
It serves historical OCR changes on request by a GraphQL query.

This application assumes 9:00 AM NZ local time on the announcement date.
In the query results the announced_on field is an ISO8601 combined UTC date and time.

## Installation

    $ lein run -m fin-data.db     # create database table and populate with data
    $ lein ring server-headless   # runs the http server
